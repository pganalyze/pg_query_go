 * pg_depend.h
 *	  definition of the "dependency" system catalog (pg_depend)
 *
 * pg_depend has no preloaded contents, so there is no pg_depend.dat
 * file; system-defined dependencies are loaded into it during a late stage
 * of the initdb process.
 *
 * NOTE: we do not represent all possible dependency pairs in pg_depend;
 * for example, there's not much value in creating an explicit dependency
 * from an attribute to its relation.  Usually we make a dependency for
 * cases where the relationship is conditional rather than essential
 * (for example, not all triggers are dependent on constraints, but all
 * attributes are dependent on relations) or where the dependency is not
 * convenient to find from the contents of other catalogs.
