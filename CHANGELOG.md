# Changelog

## 1.0.2      2021-02-18

* Update libpg_query to 10-1.0.5

    and refreshes the Postgres minor version to 10.16.


## 1.0.1      2020-11-07

* Update libpg_query to 10-1.0.3
  - This fixes ARM builds, and refreshes the Postgres patch version. This
    commit does not change the Postgres major version yet (still at PG 10).


## 1.0.0      2019-01-11

  - Note that 1.X releases will reflect Postgres 10 parser based releases from

    version.
